      Wrapper Classes provide a bridge between primitive data types and objects, allowing for more flexibility,
      additional functionality, and better compatibility in various programming scenarios.


-> Why do we use Wrapper Classes?
      Consider we want to store "Marks of Students" in Linked List but it only accepts objects. 
      List<int> is not possible as LinkedList doesn't store primitive data types
      One of the primary reasons for using wrapper classes is to convert primitive data types into objects. 
      Using wrapper classes like Integer, you can convert primitive int values into objects that can be stored in collections.

-> Usage
      ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();

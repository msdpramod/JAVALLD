->We need to maintain proper  Project structure. It is of three types
    * Layered architecture
    * Domain driven Design
    * MVC

      we need create packages
        * Contoller layer - gets request from front end -> Authentication | Validation
        * Service layer -> Business logic
        * Repository or DAO ( Data access object) -> Establish all types of things to do with DB
        * Model -> Enties

-> Domain Architecture
      Package per entity
      Ex: Movie
            * Movie Controller
            * Movie
            * Movie Repository
            * Movie Service
          User
            * User Controller
            * User
            * User Repository
            * User Service

-> MVC (Model View Controller) :
        [DB]   [UI]   [Backend]

-> Requirements
        Given an Object, we have to create multiple deep copies ( creating a new object with the same attributes as the original )

-> Version 1:
    class Client{
        public static void main(String args[]){
            Student s= new Student():
            Student copy= s; ---->( It doesn't work as we are copy reference which is the address)
        }
     }

-> Version 2:
    class Client{
            public static void main(String args[]){
                Student s= new Student();
                Student copy= new Student();
                copy.id= s.id;
                copy.name= s.name;
                copy.batch= copy.batch;
            }
         }
    }

    Cons: 1: Too lengthy code.
          2: The client needs to know implementation details like attributes of the Student class.
          3. Student classes might have some private attributes so client classes cannot access them.
          4. class  Student{
                int id;
                String name;
                String batch;
                int roll;
             }
             
             class IntelligentStudent extends Student{
                int iq;
             }
             
             class client{
                 public static void main(String args[]){
                    Student s= new Student();
                            or
                    Student s= new IntelligentStudent();
                 }
             }    
          Either of the classes can have full properties.
    
-> can we do it with a copy constructor?
        class  Student{
           int id;
           String name;
           String batch;
           int roll;
           public Student (int id, String name, String batch, int roll){
                this.id=id;
                this.name=name;
                this.batch=batch;
                this.roll=roll;
           }
       }
       class IntelligentStudent extends Student{
            public IntelligentStudent( IntelligentStudent it){
                Super(it);
                this.iq= it.iq;
       }

       Even here we can't get full properties

       Let's modify the Client code

       class Client{
            public static void main(String args[]){
                Student s= new Student();
                if(s instanceOf Student){
                    Student copy= new Student();
                }
                else{
                    Student copy= new IntegllientStudent();
                }
       }

       Here we are violating SRP, and OCP principles as it in Student class we are creating more than one change and it is not modification.

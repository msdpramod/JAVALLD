      The principle suggests creating small focused interfaces where a specific set of
      behaviors or methods are added. It let us achieve the loose coupling to class.

      The main aim of ISP is client shouldn't depend on interfaces where it has many methods
      (monolithic interfaces). The client should always depend on relevant methods to their particular
      needs.

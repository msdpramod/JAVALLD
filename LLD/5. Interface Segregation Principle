->Definition
      The principle suggests creating small focused interfaces where a specific set of
      behaviors or methods are added. It let us achieve the loose coupling to class.

      The main aim of ISP is client shouldn't depend on interfaces where it has many methods
      (monolithic interfaces). The client should always depend on relevant methods for their particular
      needs.

->Example
      From the Open-Closed Principle, We created a class FlyableBird and extended it to the Bird class.
      we move methods to the interface.  

      //Flyable Interface
      public interface Flyable {
          public void fly();
      }

      //Singable Interface
      public interface Singable {
          public void sing();
      }

      //Bird class
      public class Bird implements Flyable,Singable{
          @Override
          public void fly() {
              System.out.println("Bird is flying");
          }
      
          @Override
          public void sing() {
              System.out.println("Bird is singing");
          }
      }

      //Robot class
      public class Robot implements Singable{
          @Override
          public void sing() {
              System.out.println("Robot sings Chenna Meraya");
          }
      }

      //Client 
      public class ISPClient {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
              ISPBird b= new ISPBird();
              b.fly();
              b.sing();
      
              Robot r= new Robot();
              r.sing();
          }
      
      
      }
